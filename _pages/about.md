I am a EECS PhD student at [**MIT CSAIL**](https://www.csail.mit.edu/) advised by [**Sara Beery**](https://beerys.github.io/). My PhD has been generously supported by the NSERC-PGS-D and MIT Andrew and Erna Viterbi Graduate Fellowship. 

My research focuses on bridging **general-purpose** models with **expert-level intelligence**. I am interested in how evolving **domain knowledge** can be integrated into large AI models — through curated __*synthetic data*__, __*targeted self-supervision*__, and __*expert feedback*__ — while preserving their adaptability and generalization. More broadly, I aim to scientifically understand how to overcome real-world data gaps, guide scalable and robust specialization, and design models that, like humans, refine their expertise in alignment with the structure of complex real-world environments. 

I'm particularly interested in applications to **ecology** and **biodiversity monitoring** - previously, my work has focused on robotics applications.

Prior to my PhD, I received by BASc at the **University of Toronto** in [**Engineering Science**](https://discover.engineering.utoronto.ca/programs/engineering-programs/engineering-science/), majoring in Robotics with a minor in [Machine Intelligence](https://undergrad.engineering.utoronto.ca/academics-registration/minors-certificates/undergraduate-engineering-minors/minor-in-artificial-intelligence/). At UofT, I worked with Prof. [Sanja Fidler](https://www.cs.utoronto.ca/~fidler/) (affiliations: [UofT Machine Learning](https://learning.cs.toronto.edu/), [Vector Institute](https://vectorinstitute.ai/), [NVIDIA](https://nv-tlabs.github.io/)) on **self-supervised representation learning**, and with Prof. [Florian Shkurti](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~florian/) (affiliations: [Vector Institute](https://vectorinstitute.ai/), [UofT Robotics Institute](https://robotics.utoronto.ca/)), Prof. [Steven Waslander](https://www.trailab.utias.utoronto.ca/stevenwaslander) (affiliations: [UTIAS](https://www.utias.utoronto.ca/), U of T Robotics Institute) on **robot learning and perception**. Please see my CV below for more details.
