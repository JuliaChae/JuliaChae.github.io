I am a first-year EECS PhD student at [**MIT CSAIL**](https://www.csail.mit.edu/) advised by [**Sara Beery**](https://beerys.github.io/). I am generously supported by the MIT Andrew and Erna Viterbi Graduate Fellowship. 

My current project focuses on investigating how **synthetic data** can be used to enhance real-world vision models. More broadly, I am interested in developing robust computer vision algorithms for practical use across various domains. I'm particularly interested in applying this technology to **ecology** and **biodiversity monitoring** - previously, my work has focused on robotics applications.

Previously, I received by BASc at the **University of Toronto** in [**Engineering Science**](https://discover.engineering.utoronto.ca/programs/engineering-programs/engineering-science/) with a major in Robotics and a minor in [Machine Intelligence](https://undergrad.engineering.utoronto.ca/academics-registration/minors-certificates/undergraduate-engineering-minors/minor-in-artificial-intelligence/). At UofT, I have had the pleasure of working with worked with Prof. [Sanja Fidler](https://www.cs.utoronto.ca/~fidler/) (affiliations: [UofT Machine Learning](https://learning.cs.toronto.edu/), [Vector Institute](https://vectorinstitute.ai/), [NVIDIA](https://nv-tlabs.github.io/)) on **self-supervised representation learning**, as well as Prof. [Florian Shkurti](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~florian/) (affiliations: [Vector Institute](https://vectorinstitute.ai/), [UofT Robotics Institute](https://robotics.utoronto.ca/)), Prof. [Steven Waslander](https://www.trailab.utias.utoronto.ca/stevenwaslander) (affiliations: [UTIAS](https://www.utias.utoronto.ca/), U of T Robotics Institute), and research scientists at Epson Edge ([Epson](https://epson.com/industrial-robots-factory-automation)'s R&D robotics and algorithm development team) on various **robot learning and perception problems**, some of which have been published at **CVPR (Oral)** and **RA-L**. Please see my CV below for more details.
