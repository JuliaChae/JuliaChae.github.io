I am a 4th-year undergraduate student at the **University of Toronto**'s [**Engineering Science, Robotics**](https://engsci.utoronto.ca/program/majors/robotics-engineering/) program with a minor in [Machine Intelligence](https://undergrad.engineering.utoronto.ca/academics-registration/minors-certificates/undergraduate-engineering-minors/minor-in-artificial-intelligence/). I am currently advised by Professor [**Sanja Fidler**](https://www.cs.utoronto.ca/~fidler/) (affiliations: [Vector Institute](https://vectorinstitute.ai/), [NVIDIA](https://nv-tlabs.github.io/)) for my undergraduate thesis, which focuses on **self-supervised representation learning** to improve downstream performance in tasks such as semantic segmentation and object detection. 

I am honored to have previously done research with Professor [**Florian Shkurti**](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~florian/) (affiliations: [Vector Institute](https://vectorinstitute.ai/), [UofT Robotics Institute](https://robotics.utoronto.ca/)), Professor [**Steven Waslander**](https://www.trailab.utias.utoronto.ca/stevenwaslander) (affilations: [UTIAS](https://www.utias.utoronto.ca/), U of T Robotics Institute), and research scientists at **Epson Edge** ([Epson](https://epson.com/industrial-robots-factory-automation)'s R&D robotics and algorithm development team) on various **robot learning and perception problems**, some of which have been published at **CVPR (Oral)** and **RA-L**. Please see my CV below for more details. 

If you are an incoming student at the University of Toronto, or would like to chat in general about research and beyond, feel free to reach out to me via one of the contact information below.
